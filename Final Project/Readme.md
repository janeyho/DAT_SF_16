My name is Jane. I studied Economics and Education at UC Berkeley. After that, I worked in support for a number of years and after that, decided that I needed a career change. So that's why I'm taking this course. 

I'm interested in corporate social responsibility and how companies can help improve the welfare of humanity. I'm also interested in learning more about how ideas spread through social media. 

I perused the internet and found this a contest yelp is sponsering to help predict restaurant health scores with reviews. It sounds interesting.
